00Q And The Horrible Tiger Gun
==============================

Her Majesty's Only Field Test Spyâ„¢ hard in action for [Ludum Dare #32][ld]
"An Unconventional Weapon".

Because bullets always leave telling traces and their existence in bodies is
generally perceived as suspicious, section Q has come up with a weapon that can
only leave perfectly plausible traces. A death by bullets does raise questions
but a tiger attack is just bad luck as everyone can agree with.
